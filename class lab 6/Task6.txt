I’d use a queue since it works on a first-in, first-out basis.
When a new order comes in, it’s enqueued (added to the back). Each order stores the item names and their quantities.
When it’s time to prepare an order, it’s dequeued (removed from the front).
Before removing, I’d always check if the queue is empty to avoid underflow, and if it’s a fixed size check if it’s full before adding to prevent overflow.
To print processed orders, I’d simply output them as they’re dequeued so they appear in the same order they were received.
